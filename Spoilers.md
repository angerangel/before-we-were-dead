# Important stuff 

The information below here contains spoilers about the games story.
Only look here if you are stuck and don't know how to continue with the game.
A few of the harder parts of the game are explained below :

Each fish has two powers that can be used as mentioned above, although only one is available at the start of the game.
It might not be obvious what all of them do and the player is supposed to experiment with them. But if you can't figure it out,
here is what the powers do :

* Lightfish Power 1 - Inner Light - Lights up dark places and scares away some enemies living in the dark.
* Lightfish Power 2 - Inspire - This grants your companion more HP.
* Shadowfish Power 1 - Hide - You always have this power active. Let's you hide behind things to sneak past enemies.
* Shadowfish Power 2 - Blend In - Makes you blend in with the background maxing out your shadow meter for a short while.
* Dashfish Power 1 - Dash - Lets you swim really fast a short while.
* Dashfish Power 2 - Quick Turn - Makes a quick, 180 degree turn.
* ????-fish Power 1 - Stigma - Takes damage instead of your companion.
* ????-fish Power 2 - Mind Control - Takes control of your companionfish. The mind-link is easily broken, so you might no be able to control your companion in all circumstances.

Remember, some of your companions have powers too.

At one part of the game you are asked to take part in a race. All playable fishes except the Shadowfish can complete the race,
but all but the Dash-fish must use short-cuts to be able to win. The Shadowfish can't win the race, but can still get the
prize by using his stealth powers to get past the guard.

To get through the dark areas and to defeat the Darkbringers you have to catch an Arturus Krill by using the Shell-item
when standing on one to catch it and then using the Shell again to release it. If you have the Inner Light power or have
a companion with the same power that will also scare away the Darkbringers. Once all are gone from the junction you
won't have to scare them away again.

At the end, there is one area where you get attacked and cannot escape from the area. At this moment, your mission is to
survive until a certain amount of time has passed. Stay away from enemies and the game will eventually continue.
