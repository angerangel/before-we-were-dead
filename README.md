# Before We Were Dead, Version 1.1, made by Neotron Games


## Description 

"Before we were Dead" began as a side-project to one of our dream projects called "Limb of Eternity"
but soon grew into a complete game in its own right.
It is a relativitly simple roleplaying-game with elements of aquatic platforming but its real
strenghts lie in its richly developed world and atmosphere.

Take your time and explore, don't skip the text and just float with the waves.
Much of the lore in this game will have on impact our later works.

Enjoy and share your thoughts and theories (?) with us!

As a young Fishling the time has come for you 
to travel to Spipreef and begin your journey to adulthood. 
The Sea, however, is a dark and mysterious place and more terrors
than Badfish lurk in the deep waters around Spipreef. 

Before We Were Dead is an intresting take on classic RPG-games, aspiring
to be both an aquatic platformer and a multi-choice roleplaying game.
Exploration and character development are key ingredients to the game, as you begin
to explore what it means to be one of the Fish in a twisted and wonderous world.


## Controls 

When the game starts you get to enter the name of your Fishling and choose which type of fish
you want to play as. Each has its own abilities, strengths and weaknesses.

Enter a name by using UP and DOWN to choose a letter and select a letter using RIGHT.
Once you are done, use SPACE or ENTER to confirm.

In the game you can control your fish by rotating with LEFT and RIGHT. UP will swim in the direction
you are heading.

Use SPACE or ENTER to talk to other fish and select between different alternatives in menus and conversations.
Each fish has different powers you can use with the CONTROL button. You have to select it with the P button to use it.
You start with only one power, but once you have gained another you can select between them with the P button.
Experiment with the different powers to find out what they do. Some of them can only be used once per area. This is
indicated by a small icon on the left side of the screen.

There are also various items you come across during your journeys. You can select these using I
and use them with ALT.

If you happen to befriend another fish you can give them various orders using the O button.
Once you have the order menu open, LEFT gives the order to stay, UP gives the order to follow,
RIGHT gives the order to use power and DOWN tells your friend to leave you.
Finally, L opens the log, where various bits of information about your adventure is held
and ESC opens the save-menu where you can save your game and return to the main menu.

PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN can be used to adjust sound volume.
F switches from full screen to windowed mode.

All these buttons are also displayed within the game as a reminder.
