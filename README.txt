#Before We Were Dead, Version 1.1, made by Neotron Games


## Description :

"Before we were Dead" began as a side-project to one of our dream projects called "Limb of Eternity"
but soon grew into a complete game in its own right.
It is a relativitly simple roleplaying-game with elements of aquatic platforming but its real
strenghts lie in its richly developed world and atmosphere.

Take your time and explore, don't skip the text and just float with the waves.
Much of the lore in this game will have on impact our later works.

Enjoy and share your thoughts and theories (?) with us!

As a young Fishling the time has come for you 
to travel to Spipreef and begin your journey to adulthood. 
The Sea, however, is a dark and mysterious place and more terrors
than Badfish lurk in the deep waters around Spipreef. 

Before We Were Dead is an intresting take on classic RPG-games, aspiring
to be both an aquatic platformer and a multi-choice roleplaying game.
Exploration and character development are key ingredients to the game, as you begin
to explore what it means to be one of the Fish in a twisted and wonderous world.


## Controls :

When the game starts you get to enter the name of your Fishling and choose which type of fish
you want to play as. Each has its own abilities, strengths and weaknesses.

Enter a name by using UP and DOWN to choose a letter and select a letter using RIGHT.
Once you are done, use SPACE or ENTER to confirm.

In the game you can control your fish by rotating with LEFT and RIGHT. UP will swim in the direction
you are heading.

Use SPACE or ENTER to talk to other fish and select between different alternatives in menus and conversations.
Each fish has different powers you can use with the CONTROL button. You have to select it with the P button to use it.
You start with only one power, but once you have gained another you can select between them with the P button.
Experiment with the different powers to find out what they do. Some of them can only be used once per area. This is
indicated by a small icon on the left side of the screen.

There are also various items you come across during your journeys. You can select these using I
and use them with ALT.

If you happen to befriend another fish you can give them various orders using the O button.
Once you have the order menu open, LEFT gives the order to stay, UP gives the order to follow,
RIGHT gives the order to use power and DOWN tells your friend to leave you.
Finally, L opens the log, where various bits of information about your adventure is held
and ESC opens the save-menu where you can save your game and return to the main menu.

PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN can be used to adjust sound volume.
F switches from full screen to windowed mode.

All these buttons are also displayed within the game as a reminder.



*** Important stuff ***

The information below here contains spoilers about the games story.
Only look here if you are stuck and don't know how to continue with the game.
A few of the harder parts of the game are explained below :

Each fish has two powers that can be used as mentioned above, although only one is available at the start of the game.
It might not be obvious what all of them do and the player is supposed to experiment with them. But if you can't figure it out,
here is what the powers do :

Lightfish Power 1 - Inner Light - Lights up dark places and scares away some enemies living in the dark.
Lightfish Power 2 - Inspire - This grants your companion more HP.
Shadowfish Power 1 - Hide - You always have this power active. Let's you hide behind things to sneak past enemies.
Shadowfish Power 2 - Blend In - Makes you blend in with the background maxing out your shadow meter for a short while.
Dashfish Power 1 - Dash - Lets you swim really fast a short while.
Dashfish Power 2 - Quick Turn - Makes a quick, 180 degree turn.
????-fish Power 1 - Stigma - Takes damage instead of your companion.
????-fish Power 2 - Mind Control - Takes control of your companionfish. The mind-link is easily broken,
so you might no be able to control your companion in all circumstances.

Remember, some of your companions have powers too.

At one part of the game you are asked to take part in a race. All playable fishes except the Shadowfish can complete the race,
but all but the Dash-fish must use short-cuts to be able to win. The Shadowfish can't win the race, but can still get the
prize by using his stealth powers to get past the guard.

To get through the dark areas and to defeat the Darkbringers you have to catch an Arturus Krill by using the Shell-item
when standing on one to catch it and then using the Shell again to release it. If you have the Inner Light power or have
a companion with the same power that will also scare away the Darkbringers. Once all are gone from the junction you
won't have to scare them away again.

At the end, there is one area where you get attacked and cannot escape from the area. At this moment, your mission is to
survive until a certain amount of time has passed. Stay away from enemies and the game will eventually continue.
